# task1.squareboxes

[Tuesday 3:10 PM] Pramod

create a page with an interactive interface. Initially, this page will have an input box and a submit button. The user should be able to enter a whole number (X) into the input box. Upon clicking the submit button, the page should transition to a new view, which displays X number of boxes evenly distributed on the visible screen.

 

Subtask A: The boxes need to be arranged so that they collectively form a shape that approximates a square. To illustrate, here are some examples for specific values of X:

If X = 1, the page should display a single large box in the center of the page, occupying most of the area.
If X = 2, two boxes should be shown, occupying the full space. These could be aligned either vertically or horizontally, as both configurations would equally deviate from forming a perfect square.
If X = 3, the boxes should be arranged with two boxes in a row (or column), and the third box positioned beside one of the other boxes.
If X = 4, the boxes should form a 2x2 grid.
If X = 5, the boxes should be arranged so that they are as close to a square configuration as possible, given the constraints.

Please note that as the number of boxes increases, they should always be arranged in a way that best approximates a square shape. The goal is to display these boxes in the most square-like arrangement possible while filling up the maximum space of the visible screen.
